Project Overview
This project aims to implement and optimize machine learning classifiers for predictive modeling and data analysis in disease classification. The project uses dermoscopic images from the HAM10000 dataset to classify various skin conditions. The focus is on addressing challenges such as imbalanced class distribution and improving the classification accuracy of rare skin conditions.

Key Features
Machine Learning Algorithms:

Support Vector Machines (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Trees
Random Forest
K-means Clustering (for exploratory data analysis)
Dataset:

The HAM10000 dataset, which contains dermoscopic images for skin condition classification.
Class Balancing: Techniques applied to address class distribution challenges in the dataset.

Accuracy Optimization:

Achieved a classification accuracy improvement of up to 71% for rare skin conditions by implementing class balancing techniques and fine-tuning the models.
